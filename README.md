# Spiral Api


This project is for showing the characters and creatures from the witcher game
This project is based on a catalogue of dog clothes

## About

In this application, I have an appointment app for a Spiral's office. The user can choose from a list of houses and choose an appointment with the agent who is selling that house. The user logs in and signs up to the application using Json Web Token.

To build this application we used:

 - Ruby on Rails;
 - Active Storage;
 - Postgresql database;
 - Json Web Token (jwt);
 - (bcrypt) to crypt password;
 - Rspec to test the project;
 - Linters ( Rubocop )
